    "Measures of dispersion, such as range, variance, and standard deviation, describe the spread or variability of a data set. They complement measures of central tendency, such as the mean, median, and mode, by providing additional information about how much the data values deviate from the center.\n",
    "\n",
    "Range is the simplest measure of dispersion, and it is calculated by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value in a data set. The range provides an idea of the spread of the data but is not as informative as other measures of dispersion, as it only takes into account the two extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance and standard deviation are more informative measures of dispersion that take into account all the values in a data set. Variance is the average of the squared deviations of each value from the mean, while the standard deviation is the square root of the variance. The standard deviation is often preferred because it has the same units as the original data set, while variance is in squared units.\n",

    "\n",
    "The mean score is 84, and the range is 25 (95 - 70). To calculate the variance, we first find the deviation of each score from the mean: -14, -4, 1, 6, 11. Squaring each deviation gives: 196, 16, 1, 36, 121. The sum of these squared deviations is 370, which, divided by the number of scores (5), gives a variance of 74.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the standard deviation, we take the square root of the variance, giving us a standard deviation of approximately 8.6.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, the standard deviation tells us that the scores are fairly tightly clustered around the mean, with only a few scores deviating significantly from the mean. This information can be useful in understanding the distribution of the scores and in making decisions about how to interpret them."
